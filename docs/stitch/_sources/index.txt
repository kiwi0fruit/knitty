   contain the root `toctree` directive.

stitch
======

`stitch <https://github.com/TomAugspurger/stitch>`__ is a library for
making reproducible reports. It takes a markdown source file, executes
the code chunks, captures the output, and stitches the output into the
destination file.

Those familiar with `knitr <http://yihui.name/knitr/>`__ and `RMarkdown <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>`__
will recognize it as a python clone of those great libraries.
It's also heavily influenced by `knitpy <https://github.com/janschulz/knitpy>`__.

While ``stitch`` is written in python, it can be used for
any of the dozens of `Jupyter
kernels <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages>`__.

Examples
--------

See the :download:`examples<build/side_by_side.html>` site for a side-by-side
comparison of the markdown source and rendered output.
Links to a more complicated document rendered in various formats
is also provided.

Install
-------

At the moment, the name stitch is taken on PyPI via an inactive project.
You can install stitch from PyPI via

.. code-block:: sh

   pip install knitty

I know, it's confusing.
I've filed a claim for ``stitch`` on PyPI, but I think the people working that support queue are over-worked.
Once that gets processed, I'll put it up on conda-forge as well.
If you need a mnemonic, it's "I want knitr, but `not` the one written in `R`.
Also I wanted to confuse R users.
And knots are kind of like a buggy version of knits.

But to be clear the package name and command-line tool is ``knotr``.

You'll also need pandoc>=1.18.
Either use your system package manager, or use the ``pypandoc`` provided on conda-forge, which includes
pandoc.

Supported Python Versions
-------------------------

Stitch itself, the library, is only compatible with python 3.
However, you can compile documents with a python2 environment, as
long as you have a Python 2 kernel installed (see ``jupyter kernelspec list``).

Usage
-----

You write a markdown file, and include code chunks that look like


.. code-block:: sh

   ```{kernel_name, [chunk_name], **kwds}
   # your code here
   ```

The ``kernel_name`` is required (see ``jupyter kernelspec list``).
The ``chunk_name`` is optional; it controls things like the name assigned
to plots if they're saved to disk.

The supported keyword arguments are

* eval: bool, whether to execute the code chunk
* echo: bool, whether to include the input code chunk in the output

More options will be added.

The command-line interface is essentailly the same as pandocs.
For the most part you call

.. code-block:: sh

   knotr input_file.md -o output_file.html

You can use ``-t`` for the output type, or infer it from the file extension
of ``-o``.
All other options are passed through to pandoc.

stitch defines a few new options that control stitch-specific features

* ``--no-standalone``
* ``--no-self-contained``
* ``--use-prompt``: enable code chunk prefixes


What's in a Name?
-----------------

The name ``stitch`` has a couple meanings. Like R's ``knit``, we are
taking a source document, executing code chunks, and ``knit``\ ing or
``stitch``\ ing the output back into the document.

The second meaning is for ``stitch`` bringing together a bunch of great
libraries, minimizing the work we have to do ourselves. ``stitch`` uses

-  `Pandoc <http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html>`__ markdown parsing and
   conversion to the destination output
-  `jupyter <http://jupyter.org>`__, specifically
   `jupyter-client <https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
   for managing kernels, passing code to kernels, and capturing the
   output
-  `pandocfilters <https://github.com/jgm/pandocfilters/>`__ for
   converting code-chunk output to pandoc's AST
-  `pypandoc <https://github.com/coldfix/pypandoc>`__ for communicating
   with pandoc
-  `click <http://click.pocoo.org>`__ for the command-line interface.

``stitch`` itself is fairly minimal. The main tasks are

-  processing code-chunk arguments
-  passing the correct outputs from the jupyter kernel to pandocfilters
-  assembling all the chunks of text, code, and output in a sensible way
-  making things look nice
